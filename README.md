Click the link above to be directed to my self-coded Online Portfolio. Skills to create this were learnt during the Programming for Geographical Information Analysts module and developed further following Web-Based GIS module, incorporated into the MSc Geographical Information Systems at the University of Leeds. Today this website is updated with a collection of selected GIS, web-based GIS and coding projects completed in my spare time.

Experience in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL; skills also developed in R.
